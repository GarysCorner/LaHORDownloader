#Comments
I hacked this out pretty quick and I almost never make GUI applications (Linux user here), so the code is a little hacky and not quite as pretty as I would like.  Also the comments are a little lacking.  I was planning on cleaning it up and I may still but I need to go ahead and get it to the user that requested it so...
